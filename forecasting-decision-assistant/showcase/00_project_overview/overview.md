# Project Overview

Forecasting Decision Assistant V1 is an end-to-end decision intelligence system designed to support inventory planning.

Instead of only predicting future demand, the system translates forecasts into operational recommendations such as:
- Reorder
- Delay
- Urgency level
- Stock coverage evaluation

The goal is to bridge the gap between predictive modeling and real business decision-making.

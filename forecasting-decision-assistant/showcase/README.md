# Forecasting Decision Assistant V1

An AI-powered Inventory Decision Intelligence System that transforms multi-horizon sales forecasts into actionable inventory decisions with scenario simulation and explainable reasoning.

## 🎯 What This System Does

Most forecasting systems stop at predicting demand.

This system goes further by:
- Translating forecasts into reorder decisions
- Evaluating decision robustness under demand volatility
- Providing confidence scoring and scenario simulation
- Explaining recommendations in natural language

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

- Multi-horizon forecasting (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly)
- Inventory decision logic (Reorder / Delay / Urgency level)
- Scenario & what-if analysis
- Sensitivity testing
- Confidence scoring
- Telegram-based conversational interface
- Visual forecast outputs

## 🏗 System Flow

Sales Data  
→ Forecast Engine  
→ Scenario Simulation  
→ Decision Engine  
→ Explanation Layer  
→ User Interface (Telegram / Dashboard)

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Forecast accuracy alone does not reduce stockouts or overstock.

Actionable, explainable decisions do.
